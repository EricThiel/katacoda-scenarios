##Â Step 6: Your Mission, Should you Choose to Accept it!

To complete this mission you will be completing the code samples provided by filling in missing data. The majority of the provided code samples are complete and accurate, you need to fix or update sections indicated in the code by MISSION marks. 

For example:

```XML
# MISSION TODO <item number>: <brief description of work to be done>
url = "MISSION"
response = requests.MISSION(url)
# END MISSION SECTION
```

* Look for the # MISSION TODO indications for the start of sections where you'll need to work.
* Within the code, replace MISSION with the correct value
* When you see an # END MISSION SECTION, this is the end of this section of work.
* There could be more than one MISSION section in a code sample
* Each MISSION section may have more than one elements to be updated.

## The Goal

1. Complete the functions check_ip, set_ip, and clear_ip
1. Apply the key NETCONF concepts learned in the labs and hands on
1. Successfully execute the netconf_configure_ips.py script.

## Your Starting Point

1. Open netconf_functions.py in a text editor
1. Search for MISSION TODO to find the sections to update
1. There are 6 sections needing updates

## Caveats and Gotchas

1. The only file that needs changes is netconf_functions.py. This file is imported by netconf_configure_ips.py which is the file you will run.
1. Only replace instances of MISSION within the code. Be careful not to replace characters before or after it.
1. You need to have created the env_user.py file based on the template to enable posting to Cisco Webex Teams, formerly Cisco Spark. If you haven't created this file, you will get errors unrelated to the Mission activities.
